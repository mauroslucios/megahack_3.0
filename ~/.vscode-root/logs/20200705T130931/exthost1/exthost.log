[2020-07-05 16:59:12.071] [exthost] [error] Error: Agent terminated with exit code: 0 and signal null: A fatal error occurred. The required library libhostfxr.so could not be found.
If this is a self-contained application, that library should exist in [/root/.vscode/extensions/ms-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-1.0.2427/dotnet_modules/].
If this is a framework-dependent application, install the runtime in the global location [/usr/share/dotnet] or use the DOTNET_ROOT environment variable to specify the runtime location or register the runtime location in [/etc/dotnet/install_location].

The .NET Core runtime can be found at:- https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?missing_runtime=true&arch=x64&rid=ubuntu.20.04-x64
